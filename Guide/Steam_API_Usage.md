# Steam API Usage Guide

## Introduction

In this guide, we will explore how to utilize the Steam Web API to retrieve data related to Steam users and games. The Steam Web API provides developers with access to various endpoints for retrieving information about Steam users, their owned games, and details about games available on the Steam platform.

## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have obtained a Steam Web API key. You can request a key from the official Steam website. This key is essential for accessing the API endpoints.

## User Information

### Retrieving User Summaries

The `GetPlayerSummaries` endpoint allows us to fetch basic information about Steam users. This includes their Steam ID, username, profile picture, and other profile-related data.

Example Request:
```
http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key=YOUR_API_KEY&steamids=STEAM_ID
```

### Checking User Owned Games

Using the `GetOwnedGames` endpoint, we can retrieve a list of games owned by a specific user along with playtime information for each game.

Example Request:
```
http://api.steampowered.com/IPlayerService/GetOwnedGames/v0001/?key=YOUR_API_KEY&steamid=STEAM_ID&format=json
```

## Game Information

### Obtaining Game Details

To get information about specific games, we can use the `GetAppList` endpoint to retrieve a list of all games available on Steam. Additionally, we can use the `appdetails` endpoint to fetch detailed information about a particular game.

Example Request for Game List:
```
https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/
```

Example Request for Game Details:
```
http://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids=APP_ID
```

## Validating User IDs

Steam IDs consist of a fixed part and a 10-digit serial number. We can construct potential Steam IDs and validate them by checking if the associated profile page exists.

Example Profile URL:
```
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/STEAM_ID
```
